## Sierpinski Fractals

COMSM1201 is a unit on the MS50 course at the University of Bristol.

This repo is for my Week 9 COMSM1201 programming assignment.

You can find more information about the fractals [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_carpet).

Similarly you can find out more about SDL [here](https://www.libsdl.org/).
